## Classification of Games

#### Simultaneous / Sequential

**Simultaneous game** - a game where both players move simultaneously, or if they do not move simultaneously, the later players are unaware of the earlier players' actions (making them effectively simultaneous). 

Usually normal form is used to represent simultaneous games. 

Also known as **Strategy game.**

**Sequential game** - a game where later players have some knowledge about earlier actions.

Usually extensive form is used to represent sequential games. 

Also known as **Extensive game.** 

#### Cooperative / Non-cooperative

Cooperative game - a game where the players are able to form binding commitments externally enforced (e.g. through contract law).

Non-cooperative game - a game where players cannot form alliances or if all agreements need to be self-enforcing (e.g. through credible threats).
