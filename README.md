  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>Simultaneous game</b> (a.k.a. Strategy game) - a game where both players move simultaneously, or if they do
       not move simultaneously, the later players are unaware of the earlier players' actions (making them effectively
        simultaneous).
      <p>Usually normal form is used to represent simultaneous games.
    </td>
    <td>
      <p><b>Sequential game</b> (a.k.a. Extensive game) - a game where later players have some knowledge about earlier 
      actions.
      <p>Usually extensive form is used to represent sequential games.

      <b>Cooperative game</b> - a game where the players are able to form binding commitments externally enforced (e.g.
      through contract law).
    </td>
    <td>
      <b>Non-cooperative game</b> - a game where players cannot form alliances or if all agreements need to be
      self-enforcing (e.g. through credible threats).

    <td>
      <b>Zero-sum game</b> - a game in which each participant's gain or loss of utility is exactly balanced by the
      losses or gains of the utility of the other participants.
    </td>
    <td>
      <b>Non-zero-sum game</b> - a game in which the interacting parties' aggregate gains and losses can be less
      than or more than zero.
    </td>

    <td>
      <b>Perfect information game</b> - a game in which all players know the moves previously made by all other players.
    </td>

      <b>Imperfect information game</b> - a game in which some players don't know the moves previously made by other 
      players.
